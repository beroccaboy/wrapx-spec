# WRAPX Specification

**WRAPX** is a universal file container format that wraps files with structured metadata and portable policy enforcement. It’s designed for zero-trust environments, disconnected operation, and legacy system compatibility.

## Goals

- Keep metadata tightly bound to files
- Let users open/edit/save files as usual
- Allow third-party modules (encryption, compression, audit, etc.)
- Provide workflow support without locking into vendors
- Enable coalition-grade classification handling and policy enforcement

## Spec

Current version: [v0.1](./spec/v0.1.md)

## Who Is This For?

- Developers of secure document workflows
- CIS/metadata architects
- Zero-trust and DDIL solution builders
- Anyone who’s sick of sidecar files getting lost

## License

MIT — open, portable, yours to improve.
