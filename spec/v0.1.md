# WRAPX Specification – Version 0.1 (Draft)

**Title**: WRAPX – Universal Metadata-Wrapped File Format for Policy-Aware Payloads
**Status**: Open Draft v0.1
**Author**: \[To be filled: your name or alias]
**Licence**: MIT (recommendation; confirm)

---

## 1. Purpose

WRAPX is a universal file wrapper format designed to encapsulate any file type (payload) with structured metadata and portable policy enforcement attributes. It enables secure, auditable, and context-aware file handling — even in disconnected or untrusted environments. WRAPX is format-agnostic, legacy-compatible, and transport-neutral.

---

## 2. Design Goals

* Self-contained: metadata, policies, and audit manifest travel with the file
* Legacy-compatible: works with most existing applications (e.g., Word, Excel, Acrobat, VLC)
* Transparent UX: opens normally via shell extension or middleware
* Portable enforcement: rules and classification persist across systems
* Zero-trust ready: classification, caveats, and access policies enforceable at the edge
* Modular architecture: supports vendor-provided or community-created modules for specific file handling logic (e.g., encryption, audit, compression)

---

## 3. File Structure

A `.wrapx` file is a container (ZIP-compliant) with the following structure:

```
wrapx.zip
│
├── /payload/          # Original file (e.g., report.docx, map.tiff)
│    └── file.ext
│
├── /meta/             # Metadata manifest (JSON preferred)
│    └── manifest.json
│
├── /policy/           # Optional: rule set, TTL, caveats
│    └── policy.json
│
├── /signature/        # Optional: digital signature, checksums
│    └── sigblock.sig
│
└── /audit/            # Optional: offline logs, access attempts
     └── accesslog.json
```

---

## 4. Default Shell Behaviour

The base WRAPX runtime provides minimal enforcement or logic out of the box.

It includes:

* A user-customisable metadata form (with fields like `author`, `creation date`, etc.)
* Hooks into common OS file events (`save`, `rename`, `save as`, `new`) to capture or prompt metadata updates
* Manual or auto-population of basic metadata on file close

Everything beyond basic metadata — including encryption, compression, checksums, audit, summarisation, and zero-trust enforcement — is handled via external modules.

---

## 5. Modules and Marketplace

WRAPX supports a modular plug-in architecture.

Modules may include:

* `mod.encrypt`: Encryption of payload at rest
* `mod.hash`: Digest or checksum verification
* `mod.audit`: Tamper-proof access logging
* `mod.edge`: Tactical edge enforcement logic
* `mod.compress`: Compression for transport efficiency
* `mod.summarise`: Smart file summarisation

### Module Sources:

* **Vendor marketplace**: Commercial modules developed and maintained by vendors (e.g., Oracle, Red Hat)
* **Community modules**: Open-source, optionally fee-supported extensions

Modules can be chained into **workflow profiles** defined by users, admins, or enterprise policies.

## 6. Manifest Schema (Simplified)

Example `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "wrapx_version": "0.1",
  "file_name": "report.docx",
  "mime_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
  "classification": "SECRET-AUS",
  "owner": "example@domain.com",
  "created_at": "2025-05-06T12:00:00Z",
  "expiry": "2025-06-06T00:00:00Z",
  "tags": ["HADR", "ISR"],
  "releasable_to": ["AUS", "NZL"]
}
```

---

## 7. Behaviour Expectations

* Shell-aware systems display metadata overlays (classification banner, tooltips)
* Systems with WRAPX support can:

  * Inspect metadata
  * Validate signatures
  * Enforce access conditions (via modules)
  * Log actions to `/audit/`
* If opened on a system without WRAPX logic:

  * Payload is still accessible
  * Metadata may be ignored, but wrapper structure remains intact

---

## 8. Future Extensions

* Policy language standardisation (XACML-lite or JSON-based)
* Role-based and attribute-based access tagging
* Integration with secure enclaves or TPMs
* Cross-device audit synchronisation
* Visual metadata overlay UI for document viewers

---

Let’s build files that know how to behave.
